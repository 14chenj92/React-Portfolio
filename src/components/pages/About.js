      Hello, my name is Jonathan Chen and I am an aspiring entry-level web developer. I love learning new concepts and aim to make a career change in the future. 
      I started coding because I loved the idea of creating my own projects and I would love to understand the process that goes into creating a webpage. I will 
      continue to update my portfolio with the new projects I plan to do.
